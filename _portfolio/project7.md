### MVP 

Our MVP was developed with one main functionality in mind: <b>translating network configurations. </b>
<br> <br>
From the information obtained in the previous stages, we started by implementing the translation between the most used sellers from our form: Cisco and Huawei.

Due to the limited time, we focused on the commands used / learned in the predominant certification from the questionnaire: CCNA.
