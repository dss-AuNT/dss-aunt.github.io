### The problem

In the modern world of networking, multi-vendor solutions are becoming increasingly used for a variety of reasons including reducing the overall cost of building the network and increasing the security by the following defence in-depth approach.

### The solution

Following this trend, our solution is to provide a solution that aims at reducing the time required for getting the network up and running, by using a write-once-use-many approach that automatically translates the device configuration from one vendor to another.
