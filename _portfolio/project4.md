### Face-to-face interviews

In order to find potential customers for validation, we started from the list of contacts we managed to gather from the survey we conducted two weeks ago. Out of our 37 responses, 10 respondents were interested in finding more about our initiative and provided us with their email address. Out of them, we selected 8 respondents that seemed to us more relevant to our needs.

</div>

Out of the potential candidates that we reached out to, 4 of them accepted our invitation and we managed to plan the interviews.
For the planification of the interviews we used <a href="https://doodle.com/poll/x4sghm932egb8g5z" target="_blank">this Doodle</a>.


Unfortunately, when the time for the interviews came up, 2 of our 4 candidates did not show up, so we conducted only 2 interviews, one with a professional potential client and one with a hobbyist.
