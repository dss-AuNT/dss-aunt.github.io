### Size of target market

We conducted a market research to determine the size of our target market. With our product, we intend to target the Enterprise Network market, which we discovered that was currently estimated at <b> US$67.4 </b> Billion in 2020 and is projected to reach a revised size of <b>US$97.2 </b> Billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of <b> 5.4% </b> over the analysis period 2020-2027. <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/08/20/2284035/28124/en/Global-Enterprise-Network-Equipment-Market-Report-2021-Wider-Availability-of-IPv6-Ready-Products-to-Drive-Adoption-among-Enterprises.html">(Click here for more information)</a>

The target market is shown in the figure below:

### Number of competitors 

The Enterprise Network market consists of the various networking vendor companies, such as Cisco, Huawei, HP, Dell and many others. After our research, we identified that the approximate number of players acting in this market is 25.

  <img class="img-fluid" width="750px" src="assets/img/M6/MajorPlayers.JPG"/>
</div>

 Among those, we did not identify a major competitor. After our research, Cisco could be a potential competitor, since it developed a similar product, <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus7000/sw/system-management/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_7000_Series_NX-OS_System_Management_Configuration_Guide-RI/converting_cli___commands_to_network_configuration_format.pdf">XMLIN</a> , allowing network engineers to convert CLI commands to the NETCONF protocol format, loading these configurations on the network devices. We consider that this tool, even though is similar to our project idea, it lacks the main functionality that we wish to implement for AuNT: translation between different networking configuration languages, so we decided not to include Cisco’s XMLIN as a competitor. We also did not identify other similar products with our purpose, so we can state that we do not have any competitors.


### Estimation of a potential market share

Based on the support policy for network devices, after a period of time, support is no longer provided for the network devices, since they are considered obsolete. This encourages the companies to upgrade their devices. For example, networking vendors like Huawei and Cisco have a policy of 5 years of support for their network devices.

  <img class="img-fluid" width="600px" src="assets/img/M6/cisco5.png"/>
</div>

Based on this fact, we assume for our estimation that each company will decide to regularly change its network devices after a cycle of 5 years. Since we cannot estimate the exact timing of change for each company, we assumed that during a cycle of 5 years, an equal percentage of companies will change their devices each year, leading to a 20% of the companies upgrading their network devices each year. 
<br>

 Currently, even though companies change their network devices regularly, many of them will decide to continue using the devices provided by the same vendor used previously, since it implies less costs for the configuration and training of the engineers. Not many companies will decide to change their vendor because of the complex and expensive process of learning a new configuration language and translating the configuration of the current devices into an equivalent configuration of the devices provided by a new vendor.
 <br>

 Our purpose is to eliminate the fear of the companies to try out new technologies that at some point in time may be more profitable by making the transitioning process easier, faster and less expensive. As our idea gains popularity, more and more companies will be willing to adhere to such solutions, thus the possibility of growth being exponential. 
<br>

We cannot determine a size for the market since there isn’t a market for our product yet, so we will make assumptions based on the number of clients that adhere to our services. This way, we consider that we will have a market share of 100% during the first 5 years.

### Estimation of total market value

In order to determine our market value, we supposed that, on average, each client will  make a purchase of 100 network equipment, of which 20 would need a thorough configuration. The average price for a configuration translation would be 50$, resulting in an average of 1000$ revenue per client. We estimate a growth of 150% per year in number of clients we assume the following:

### Conclusions

After the market research that we conducted, we determined that at the moment, there is no competition for our product. This way, we intend to profit on this advantage and make our product popular among IT companies and attract potential clients. Even though initially our profit will not be substantial, we estimate that in time the number of clients will grow much faster with the product becoming more popular and our profit will increase considerably.
