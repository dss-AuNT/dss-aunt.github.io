We tried getting our product in the hands of both targeted categories. Below we summarize the feedback we received and how we perceived it.

### Hobbyists
From hobbyists we received a more general feedback, based on the usability of the application (UI/UX), but it mostly confirms the assumptions we made when we developed the wireframes.

### Professionals
On the professional side, we received the feedback below from a Network Engineer at Huawei:

This one confirmed the principal shortcoming of our prototype: lack of support for all the commands and features of a vendor. It was expected that someone working in the field would need a few features/commands that are rarely used, yet more difficult. Yet, since this is our plan (continuously adding features), we think we're on track. He enjoyed the few validations features we have (IP validation) and offered us the suggestion to have a list of features/commands available so what the product can do and the way to use it is clearer.
