### Populating the landing page

In order to populate the landing page, we shared the link on different social platforms( eg. Linkedin, Whatsapp, ?Facebook.)

<div class="container-fluid">
  <img class="img-fluid" width="350px" src="assets/img/proof/whatsapp5.png"/>
  <img class="img-fluid" width="350px" src="assets/img/proof/linkedin5.PNG"/>
  <img class="img-fluid" width="350px" src="assets/img/proof/linkedin5_2.jpeg"/>
  <img class="img-fluid" width="350px" src="assets/img/proof/facebook5.PNG"/>
</div>


### Analytics 

Our most successful platform was LinkedIn. That makes sense as it is technically/professionally oriented and our solution targets a niche of IT. A close contender are direct accesses which we attribute to our lack of knowledge in using analytics when distributing to Whatsapp.

</div>

From Google Analytics we can also see that we have a decent engagement rate (88% for LinkedIn and 66% for direct access).

</div>

As expected, without paying for ads most of our traffic came from Romania, with a few outliers from countries like Germany, Turkey, United States.

### Hotjar

From the heatmap we can see that our page is intuitive enough, with users following the natural flow of our landing page, with a little bit over 20% of them reaching the subscription form.

<!-- ### Conclusions
The interviews that we conducted helped us understand better the vision of our potential clients. Even though we did not manage to conduct all the required interviews, we gathered positive feedback from our interviewees and, most importantly, very relevant information that helped us validate and consolidate the features of our application. -->
